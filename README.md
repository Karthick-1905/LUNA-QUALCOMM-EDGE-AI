##  Description

*LUNA* is a standalone Windows application that empowers podcasters, content creators to record, edit, and publish professional-grade audio and videoâ€”entirely on-device, with no internet, no latency, and no cloud dependency.

Unlike traditional tools like Descript or Adobe Podcast, LUNA prioritizes data privacy, real-time performance, and offline productivity. By leveraging Snapdragon X Elite's NPU with quantized deep learning models and mixed-precision inference, it delivers a complete, responsive editing pipeline locally.

Whether you're batch-transcribing long sessions or live-editing transcripts, LUNA redefines podcast editing with modular, asynchronous, and hardware-accelerated intelligenceâ€”all while keeping your data on your device.
